Additionally, maximum heart rate steadily lowers in a linear fashion as age increases; this negative correlation indicates that older people's hearts cannot beat as quickly as when they were younger. Lower maximum heart rates have been linked to increased chances of heart disease, supporting the claim that the elderly are more likely to suffer from heart disease.
